# Marginalised Gaussian Processes with Nested Sampling

This repository offers an interface between GPflow and the nested sampling package dynesty. This permits marginalisation of the hyperparameters of Gaussian Processes, as described in  (https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.16344), and presented at [NeurIPS 2021](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2021).
